# cocoa-bindings
This is just a silly little Mac app that connects to Twitter's streaming search API and displays tweets (in real-time) for your query. To make things a bit more complicated, it also summarizes tweeted URLs (so you can see the most popular news story for a given topic) and the top hashtags.

The whole point of this is to demonstrate how much you and do with very little controller code when using Cocoa Bindings. There's basically just the CoreData model layer (generated by MOGenerator) and a Twitter API helper class, which uses another open source library for all the heavy lifting. Inside the `MainWindowController` you'll find very little code at all. Basically just the CRUD for creating and deleting searches.

Without bindings, you'd have to implement table video delegates and datasources connected to CoreData four times. With bindings (which I realize can be both good and bad), all of that code is eliminated.

You'll want to insert your own Twitter OAuth keys into `TwitterHelper.m` and also do a `pod install` before running.
